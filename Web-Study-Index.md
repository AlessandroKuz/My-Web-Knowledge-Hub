# Web-Study-Index
The following page serves as an #inbox of all the knowledge in my web study journey.
## Pre-requisites
To properly understand how the web works, it is useful to know the basics of computing and how does a computer works, the following page provides some good fundational resources: [The Odin Project - Computer Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-computer-basics).

## URL
More info on a [[URI-And-URL]].
## HTTP
For more info on [[HTTP]].
## Modern Web
[[HTML]]
[[CSS]]
[[JavaScript]]
Each of those serves a different purpose:
- HTML is for structure and semantics (meaning).
- CSS is for styling and layout.
- JavaScript and APIs are for controlling dynamic behavior.
Each of those works on the #DOM or #Document-Object-Model.
In addition one may usa a #Server-side-Language, like #python, #PHP and so on.
### Static vs Dynamic web pages
- If the document gets loaded as is and does not get modified further it is called **Static**.
- If the document gets loaded dynamically and changes with user interaction, it is called **Dynamic**; this usually occurs when a #Server-side-Language is used.
## Hyperlinks
Could be:
- **Internal**: when referencing a page within the same website
- **External**: when referencing a page from a different website
- **Incoming**: an external link to your website
An #Anchor ties different sections of a same document together; see [[URI-And-URL#Anchor]] for more details.
## DNS
Domain names ([[URI-And-URL#Domain/Authority]]) are an important way to convert an #IP to a human readable address.
## Client and servers
- A #Client is a computer requesting something
- A #Server is a provider of something
- A #Request is what a client asks of a server
- A #Response is the server answer of the clients request
Client Request -> Server Response
