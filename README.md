The following is an Obsidian Vault to keep track of all the knowledge related to the #Web, #Internet and related fields.

## Vault-Objective
The objective of the following #Obsidian-Vault is to keep all information #Web related in a single place. More specifically it is good for:
- Keeping all the gained knowledge in one place
- Take note of definitions and concept to further reference
- Keep track of the next steps
- Organize / tie in all the concepts together, especially thanks to the built-in Obsidian graph tool

## Reinventing-The-Wheel
One fair criticism of the following vault is that "There's no need to reinvent the wheel", as there are already available a vast number of resources pertaining to the #Web-Development Subject, some notable ones are the following:
- [MDN - Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/Learn)
- [TOP - The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/)

Yet I still decided to create a dedicated space to gather all the #web knowledge I'll acquire on the topic into a single "semi-organized" space (don't quote me on that, as I cannot make any promises), both for myself and any other person that might find it useful.

Sometimes it is good to "Reinvent the wheel", especially during the learning phase, as it an important step to #Master-The-Fundamentals.
