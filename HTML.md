# HTML
An HTML file contains and the defines the structure of a #webpage, which gets converted to a tree-like structure called a #DOM or #Document-Object-Model.
Certain #HTML elements when parsed will trigger new #HTTP requests, for example:
- Link
- Script
- Img, video, audio
## CSS
Each HTML element can also have some associated [[CSS]] proprieties, which define things like color, shape, dimensions and so on.
## JavaScript
For extra page interactivity [[JavaScript]] can be used.
